# SenOS operating system (by M1st)

## What is SenOS?

**SenOS** is a **Python-programmed operating system**.

In early developing stages, **SenOS** is only a **console-based application run on Windows's Command Prompt, Linux Bash Terminal and MacOS Terminal**.

**SenOS** aims to be **lightweight, user-friendly, and compatible with a wide range of hardwares (even old ones)**.


## How to operate SenOS?

- **SenOS** is simply a `.py` file that **_CAN'T_** be initialized unless you have Python installed on your current operating system.

- Since it is still on its pre-alpha stage, users may encounter bugs or errors during the using process so make sure to send us the bugs encountered (plus screenshots if possible) so that we can fix them as soon as possible.

* Steps to download and operate **SenOS** :
	+ **Step 1**: Download the `SenOS_<current_month>_<current_year>`
		(For example: `SenOS_Jan_2022`)

	+ **Step 2**: Make sure to have the newest version of Python installed on your operating system (and added to `PATH` in order to operate successfully via Windows's command prompt)

	+ **Step 3**: After the download has finished, go to the `SenOS_<current_month>_<current_year>.zip` file and extract it.

	+ **Step 4**: Once the extraction is completed, you will see some files, which consist of: `README.txt`, `log,txt`, `SenOS_main`, and other important files(components) to keep SenOS functional and usable.
	**(WARNING : DON'T ATTEMPT TO OR FORCIBLY DELETE ANY FILES IN THE FOLDER, OR ELSE THE OPERATING SYSTEM WON'T WORK AS PROPERLY AS IT SHOULD.)**

	+ **Step 5**: Open up your command prompt(For Windows)/terminal(For Linux, MacOS) and **REMEMBER** to change your directory to `SenOS_<current_month>_<current_year>` file that you extracted earlier.

	+ **Step 6**: Type `python SenOS_main.py` to initialize the operating system.

	Congratulations!

	Now you have successfully operated SenOS!
